### Pull Requests
I'm happy to receive pull requests. If you submit new functionality,
please ensure your code includes documentation and unit tests. The
code you submit will need to be licensed compatibly with the MIT
license. If you wrote it yourself, add your name as a contributor.
If you didn't, please add the original author as a contributor. If
you're looking for ways to contribute, take a look at any open
feature requests; these are things I probably won't have time to
work on myself.

### Bug Reports
If you find a bug, I'm eager to hear about it, so please open an issue 
and report it. I'll try to get to it as soon as I have the time. 
Unfortunately, for the time being, this is a one-person show, so be 
prepared to wait -- unless you would like to submit a fix yourself, 
which would make my day. :)

### Feature Requests
I'm happy to receive feature requests, but in all honesty, I probably
won't get time to implement them unless I have a specific use case
for an unrelated project I'm working on.
